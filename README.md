Built With

React.js
Firebase


 I tried to make a compact application with many features together. These features; registration, member login, adding photos, getting information from API, seeing users' online status, adding and deleting tasks, assigning a task to a specific user, only the task creator can delete the task, viewing by category, not showing the site content to non-members, real-time public chat. And finally registering all features on firebase.
